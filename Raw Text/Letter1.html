           <p id="p-1">
               <br id="ln-1"/><span class="lineNum"/>Harriet had stayed in <span class="location" title="borough">Greenwich</span> over night so went in 
               <br id="ln-2"/><span class="lineNum"/>town with us. We drove the station wagon with our 
               <br id="ln-3"/><span class="lineNum"/>bags.Very cleverly selected as we had two suit 
               <br id="ln-4"/><span class="lineNum"/>cases each and a  bottle bag and the typewriter-plus 
               <br id="ln-5"/><span class="lineNum"/>a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag (reserved for 
               <br id="ln-6"/><span class="lineNum"/>purchases. THIS folded up on the bottom of a suit case 
               <br id="ln-7"/><span class="lineNum"/>for future use!
           </p>
           <p id="p-2">
               <br id="ln-8"/><span class="lineNum"/>State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had 
               <br id="ln-9"/><span class="lineNum"/>a send off party. Billy was hiding behind a curtain 
               <br id="ln-10"/><span class="lineNum"/>and was a HUGE surprise   Caryl had arranged it this way 
               <br id="ln-11"/><span class="lineNum"/>Gail's mother and a friend- Dale and Kissy got to the 
               <br id="ln-12"/><span class="lineNum"/>dock just after 10.30 and were not allowed to come on 
               <br id="ln-13"/><span class="lineNum"/>board. Too bad.
           </p>
           <p id="p-3">
               <br id="ln-14"/><span class="lineNum"/>Huge ship. Like a section of the <span class="location" title="hotel">Waldorf</span>- the 
               <br id="ln-15"/><span class="lineNum"/><span class="location" title="hotel">Peacock Alley</span> plus several of the dining rooms- afloat 
               <br id="ln-16"/><span class="lineNum"/>Streams of PEOPLE mulling about.
           </p>
           <p id="p-4">
               <br id="ln-17"/><span class="lineNum"/>We had a table in the dining room with 5 other female 
               <br id="ln-18"/><span class="lineNum"/>ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked 
               <br id="ln-19"/><span class="lineNum"/>us over and next meal he wasn't there. So we drewano 
               <br id="ln-20"/><span class="lineNum"/>another lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange 
               <br id="ln-21"/><span class="lineNum"/>addresses and were photographed together.
           </p>
           <p id="p-5">
               <br id="ln-22"/><span class="lineNum"/>Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the 
               <br id="ln-23"/><span class="lineNum"/>movies and pools. I won a few dollars on a pool.
           </p>
           <p id="p-6">
               <br id="ln-24"/><span class="lineNum"/>A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. 
               <br id="ln-25"/><span class="lineNum"/>and Caryls asked us for cocktails one evening. Then 
               <br id="ln-26"/><span class="lineNum"/>there were the parties of the Captain and the Purser 
               <br id="ln-27"/><span class="lineNum"/>Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight 
               <br id="ln-28"/><span class="lineNum"/>in cabin class, she was to steer about over <span class="location" title="continent">Europe</span>. 
               <br id="ln-29"/><span class="lineNum"/>She came up and had tea with us one day.
           </p>
           <p id="p-7">
               <br id="ln-30"/><span class="lineNum"/>The Captain and Purser both were on the <span class="location" title="region">Franconia</span> 
               <br id="ln-31"/><span class="lineNum"/>about  years ago- as under officers- on a world 
               <br id="ln-32"/><span class="lineNum"/>cruise we were on. Both extremely cordial.
           </p>
           <p id="p-8">
               <br id="ln-33"/><span class="lineNum"/>Took train around noon for <span class="location" title="city">Paris</span>. Hot as blazes. 
               <br id="ln-34"/><span class="lineNum"/>and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route. Quite good.
           </p>
           <p id="p-9">
               <br id="ln-35"/><span class="lineNum"/>Paris and piled our belongings into a cab and 
               <br id="ln-36"/><span class="lineNum"/>landed at <span class="location" title="hotel">Le Bristol</span>- a rather smallish hotel where 
               <br id="ln-37"/><span class="lineNum"/>diplomats go- white marble and mirrors. We had an oval 
               <br id="ln-38"/><span class="lineNum"/>white paneled bedroom and an adjoining white paneled 
               <br id="ln-39"/><span class="lineNum"/>round sitting room. (which we didn't need and later gave
               <br id="ln-40"/><span class="lineNum"/>up.)
           </p>
           <p id="p-10">
               <br id="ln-41"/><span class="lineNum"/>Very weary and after some refreshing 
               <br id="ln-42"/><span class="lineNum"/>tub baths went over to the <span class="location" title="restaurant">Crenailliere</span>(nearby) where 
               <br id="ln-43"/><span class="lineNum"/>we had a very delicious dinner.
