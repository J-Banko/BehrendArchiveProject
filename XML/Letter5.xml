            <ln n="1"/>THIS was a DAY! M.G. and Clyde, pLus Gail and myself all 
            <ln n="2"/>in Mercedes' Ford, travelled over theMotor Highway. First 
            <ln n="3"/>lookked up the Flea Market which was just next to nothing 
            <ln n="4"/>Then on to Bruges.passing cultVAted fields and neat
            <ln n="5"/>little houses.M. drove us all arouND by the canals 
            <ln n="6"/>etc.A truly wonderful and unspoiled little city of the 
            <ln n="7"/>past. Many hundreds of years old.       We had lunch on the
            <ln n="8"/>square.Got a Victoria with a horse named Bella. A very
            <ln n="9"/>FAT horse but she didn't have to go very fast.M.G. got 
            <ln n="10"/>very conversational with Bella's owner.IN French. Visited 
            <ln n="11"/>enclosure of the Beguinage & the chapel where the sisters 
            <ln n="12"/>of the nursing order were chanting.   Being   sunday almost 
            <ln n="13"/>all the shops were closed.  But we saw the women making
            <ln n="14"/>the bobbin lace and bought a few pieces.   The buildingS 
            <ln n="15"/>around the enclosure called the Beguinage were used in 
            <ln n="16"/>olden times for|wives and widows, and women of some stand
            <ln n="17"/>ing when the men were at war or had been killed etc.

            <ln n="22"/>The Square is a breath taking spot 
            <ln n="23"/>The buildings surrounding it
            <ln n="24"/>are ratheR Dutch or Flemish in sty 
            <ln n="25"/>style. The tips of the irregulad
            <ln n="26"/>roofs being surmounted by the
            <ln n="27"/>embelished with gold paint|on the sills and carvings. 
            <ln n="28"/>The llights on the buildings at night create a truly 
            <ln n="29"/>beautiful and unreal effect.  Like part|of a fairy tale
        </p>
            <p>
