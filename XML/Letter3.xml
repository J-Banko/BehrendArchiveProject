        <text>LEAVING PARIS FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN THE COUNTRY</text>
    </headLine>
    
   
        <p>Breakfast in our round white sitting room. Very smartly packed into ONE suit case, leaving all the rest at Le Bristol for our return from the country afew days later. Took the noisy little morning train for Tours-about 2 i/2 hours. We could see several huge chateaux up on the hillsides. Ambroise for one. dust before we reached Tours. Mr Dickinson met us. AT Hig father was Jo Davidson the famous sculptor- and the Davidsons live in the old farm manor-house that was his.. We drove to Brechron their farm, where we had a very substantial lunch- as Mrs. D explained we would need it as we had a busy afternoon before us. Sorrel soup, steak and a salad. We had a pleasant room on the ground floor a tiny dressing room and a HUGE bath toom with a tub  large enough for a baby elephant!</p>

        <p>After LUNCHEON we started out with Jack Davidson in his cosy little car for the "afternoon tour".
        
        Went first to Chenoceaux- this chateau we went inside of. Lofty hall and rooms with paintings of people belonging to the various families connected with the chateau, many years ago. One of the interesting parts of tis particular mansion was the covered bridge from the further end of the building to the shore on the other side. This was built up over the river by a series of arches. An important buildin g was to have been errected on the further side of the river connected with teh bridge. It reminded us of the bridge in Florence-Ponte Vecchio.
        
        
        From here we drove thro the lovely river valleys and above. Three of these rivers.AMbroise we saw from below The round tower from the river side was the one the riders went up to the stables- on  a ramp inside the huge tower. The large tower on the other side was that used by royalty ,etc;carriages went in this one up to an important court. We went inside the parts of the castle-absolutely bare rooms- being repaired IN the church and a tomb. Saw a chateau or two and various churches outide. Then visited Sache, Balkac old home- now a museum. An interestint rather tall building- not especially large. The medium sized living</p></page>
        
        
        
        <page num="2"><p>was furnished exactly as Balzak left it. Wall paper in imatation of heavy folds of material with borders and rosetters in a mustard shade. Ratyer gay flowers chitz on the chairs and sofa. The view from all the windows very lovely.The floor above was his bedroom. Avery small bed fitted into an alcove.(such a steep narrow stairway to get up to this room) Across the l little hall was a spacious room whichcontained a large collection of Jo Davidson's work. Almost entirely busts of famous people. A life size figure of Gertrude Stien. The busts were all arranged on tall swuare pedestals of varying The likeness being startlingly fine. We could seee from these high windows far over the beautiful rolling country-and over the tiny villages scattered over the fields. Supper MrsDavidson explained was a very light meal - it was excellent Sorrell soup Soufleeland a saldd.   In the evenong we went with Jack to see the "illumanation" A little way down the road at the chateau Azay d'Rideau. A heavenly place surrounded by a moat filled with water(as it should be!) It was then quite dark. People sat about in the ground on rugs- some walked about. Beautiful music and a story of a tragic happening iN the castle (many years ago) was recited from the castly windows. The windows being lit as it wouLD fit into the story.</p>
        
        <p>Thursday July 21st Breakfast in our room. About I0 we started the Davidsons and theirnlittle boy plus a picnic. First to a monestry- Loches - the original walls enclosing it. Large wheat fields were within the enclosure. The buiodings were of the     century. We then drove thro' what was teh royal forrest-came to a pretty round thached summer house. As it rained a little we ate our excellent lunch at this place.</p>
        
        <p>Went back to Loche, the chateau and church. Visited the tomb of Agnes Sorel. and went thro' many barren rooms in the chateau- one of which Joan of Arc was supposed to have had her second audience with the King. At this time she was said to have selected him from the large gathering showers.        Then to chinon- where we had tea and walked thro the old vallage.This particular town is HELD by the government as to building and changed of and sort.(Like Chester in England and rRotherburg in Germany) In the evening a couple came for over night. We could have managed very nicely without HIM. Very noisy and disagreed with everybody and every thing!</p>
        
        <p>July 22nd. Day of departure.Drove to St. Pierre de Clochs just outside of Tour- where we took the II.20 train fro Paris. Mrs Davidsons Mother drove over with us. Her sister lives in the U.S.A at Hanover. The car acted up on the way over- but we got there!!</p></page>

    <p>Now we leave for Paris- not very much of a visit but there is much to see in Europe- and many places we may never get around to again' However Paris I hope to visit again.</p>
        
       <p> We left Le Bristol for the Airways a little before 9 and stopped enroute at Hermes to collect a scarf-decorated with all the famous chateaux of France- a few of which we have visited during our recent little stay in Tours. This scarf a souviner for Gail. Then on to the air port. A two-motor plane awaited us (this did not entrane ME) Not many passengers. We paid about $6.00over weight- but expected this anyway.About 3/4 hour's flight among the clouds. A bit bumpy. But we GOT there O.K.</p> 
        
        <p>Mercedes Bucher met us at the Brussels terminal with her new grey Ford Sedan. It was good to see her! We always have fun. She drove us to Brussels and thro the lovely parks. Landing at the Metropole (where M. alwso lives until her apartment is ready) we wnet up to our rooms. Nothing very fancy but quiet. Some flowers arrived from M.G. and Clyde and directly After, in they came!They were at the Atlanta hotel almost next door on this busy street. We all trailed over to the GRand Place. Where we had a truly delicious meal of steak potoes etc ,onlittle table placed outon the sidewalk. This beautiful Place is to me one of the most beautiful sigs have ever seen. It is very large and neatly paved with blocks of stone- as are most of the streets in Brussels The distinguished Town Hall(Hotel de Ville) occupies practiced the end, facing the lovely group ofGuild houses or  Corporation Houses. All around the square are these very Beautiful structures, darkened with age, the carvings and cornices etc Decoratee with gold.The facades are sumourous by irregular roofs topped with emblems of the guild. A baket, a lamp, The effect at night, whenthe buildings are wonderfully illumanated, is something never to be forgotten.</p>
        <p>WE drove with M. in her cosy grey Ford all thro the lovely parks.Huge trees, lakes, pleasant rolling meadows, Flowers in spots,we drove past many famous buildings</p>
        
       <p> Palias de Justice etc. After a rest period we set forth again for our Beloved Square where we had a delicious dinner- so good and so cheap.In a charming little restur approached the a tiny paved ally. IN the Flemish STYLE Carved panels,and old Delft plates pewter and all the brass most beutifully polished.Le Bon Vondiuex Temps. Be SUre to visit this if you go to Brussels!</p></page>
